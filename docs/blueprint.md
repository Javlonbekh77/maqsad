## Core Features:

- User Profile Creation: Allow users to create personal profiles with their goals and habits.
- Group Creation and Joining: Enable users to create and join groups based on shared goals and habits.
- Task Management within Groups: Allow group admins to create tasks with specific instructions and rewards for members.
- To-Do List Generation: Generate personalized to-do lists for users based on their joined groups and selected tasks.
- Coin Tracking and Leaderboard: Implement a coin system where users earn coins for completing tasks, and display a leaderboard of top users and groups. If an AI tool is unsure when/if it should use the Coin information when making a determination or giving a reward to a user, it should consider how frequently the user asks the tool about their standing or number of tasks completed and if those numbers look suspiciously uniform, then it is probably necessary to implement the reward.
- Task Completion Verification: Require users to confirm task completion with a reminder about honesty and integrity.
- AI-Powered Task Suggestions: Utilize AI to suggest relevant tasks and groups to users based on their profiles and activity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant teal (#008080) evoking balance and growth, fitting for a goal-oriented application. We avoid the cliched use of Teal.
- Background color: A very light grayish-teal (#E0F8F8), providing a gentle and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted yellowish-green (#808000) as an accent to provide contrast while complementing the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile humanist sans-serif, ideal for both headlines and body text, ensuring readability and a modern feel.
- Use clear and intuitive icons to represent tasks, groups, and achievements.
- Design a clean and focused layout to minimize distractions and maximize user engagement.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and enhance user experience.
